Basic implementation of OCR images and pdf files with pre/post-processing. 

### Usage

From main directory run :

`python main.py --input_path='./input/file.jpg' --output_path='./output/file.txt'`

Also can be used :

`python main.py --help`

Post-processing can be improved by adding NLP libraries to the project and working with dictionaries, punctuation, and thereby can be improved recognition accuracy.

There is also second part of the task - .<a href="https://github.com/flaymax/ocr_task/blob/main/NexusAIChallenge/nexus_BykovAlexandr.pdf">NexusAI-challenge</a>
