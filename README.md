Basic implementation of OCR images and pdf files with pre/post-processing. 

### Usage

From main directory run :

`python main.py --input_path='./input/file.jpg' --output_path='./output/file.txt'`

Also can be used :

`python main.py --help`

Post-processing can be improved by adding NLP libraries to the project and working with dictionaries, punctuation, and thereby can be improved recognition accuracy.
